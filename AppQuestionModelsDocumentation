        int timestamp         // Receives a Date back from the server which could not be converted to a DateTime easily, 
                                 so I have it as an int for now, but we aren't currently using it.

        string question_id                                // the identification string of the question. We use it to grab individual question data 
                                                             and perform update operations

        int last_modified                                 // another Date that we get back from the server that looks purely numerical based, 
                                                             so it might not make an easy conversion to DateTime. Still not being used though.
